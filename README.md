# AWS Lambda custom runtime with Java 18
An AWS Lambda custom runtime to enable Java 18 support on a minimalistic JRE, which only includes the Java modules required by the application.

![overview](docs/overview.png)

1.	Download the preferred Java version and take advantage of jdeps, jlink and Class Data sharing to create a minified and optimized Java runtime based on the application code (function.jar).
2.	Create a bootstrap file with optimized starting instructions for the application.
3.	Package the application code, the optimized Java runtime and the bootstrap file as a zip file.
4.	Deploy the runtime, including the app, to AWS Lambda e.g. via the AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK)

## Getting started

1. Download or clone the repository.
   
2. install prerequisite software:
    1. Install [AWS CDK](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/getting_started.html)   
    2. Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

3. Build and package the AWS Lambda function and create the AWS Lambda custom runtime using Docker:

```bash
./build.sh
```

4. Provision the AWS infrastructure (Amazon API Gateway, AWS Lambda and Amazon DynamoDB) using AWS CDK:

```bash
./provision-infrastructure.sh
```

The API Gateway endpoint URL is displayed in the output and saved in the file `infrastructure/target/outputs.json`. The contents are similar to:

```
{
  "LambdaCustomRuntimeMinimalJRE18InfrastructureStack": {
    "apiendpoint": "https://<API_ID>.execute-api.<AWS_REGION>.amazonaws.com"
  }
}
```

## Using Artillery to test the changes

First, install prerequisites:

1. Install [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) and [Artillery Core](https://artillery.io/docs/guides/getting-started/installing-artillery.html)
2. Run the following script from the projects root directory:

```bash
artillery run -t $(cat infrastructure/target/outputs.json | jq -r '.LambdaCustomRuntimeMinimalJRE18InfrastructureStack.apiendpoint') -v '{ "url": "/custom-runtime" }' infrastructure/loadtest.yml
```


### Check results in Amazon CloudWatch Insights

1. Navigate to Amazon **[CloudWatch Logs Insights](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/home?#logsV2:logs-insights)**.
2. Select the log groups `/aws/lambda/custom-runtime-java-18` from the drop-down list
3. Copy the following query and choose **Run query**:

```
 filter @type = "REPORT"
    | parse @log /\d+:\/aws\/lambda\/(?<function>.*)/
    | stats
    count(*) as invocations,
    pct(@duration+coalesce(@initDuration,0), 0) as p0,
    pct(@duration+coalesce(@initDuration,0), 25) as p25,
    pct(@duration+coalesce(@initDuration,0), 50) as p50,
    pct(@duration+coalesce(@initDuration,0), 75) as p75,
    pct(@duration+coalesce(@initDuration,0), 90) as p90,
    pct(@duration+coalesce(@initDuration,0), 95) as p95,
    pct(@duration+coalesce(@initDuration,0), 99) as p99,
    pct(@duration+coalesce(@initDuration,0), 100) as p100
    group by function, ispresent(@initDuration) as coldstart
    | sort by coldstart, function
```
